#Fiesta Event Portal

This event portal is a user friendly one. Using this event portal we can create a unique account and register all events in our college. We can also add events with criteria like max participants, location and date and time. A confirmation email will be send to the delegate after then event is registered. Clicking on a event  shows all registered attendees for that event. A list of upcoming events are listed in the portal. Inspite of all these advantages it also has its own demerits.
